# Codex Handoff

## Current Repository

- Repository: `frontend-poc-arrow`
- Branch: `feat/frontend-backend-integration`
- Do not modify Git remotes automatically.
- Do not modify `backend-poc-arrow` unless a blocking API contract issue is found and reported first.

## Completed Phase

- Phase 8: Frontend Backend Integration.

Previous completed and merged phases:

- Phase 3 Flutter Bootstrap.
- Phase 4 Graph-Based Game Engine Domain.
- Phase 5 Manual Graph-Based Levels.
- Phase 6 Playable Game UI with Local Manual Levels.
- Phase 7 Local Progress, Level Unlocking, Settings, Audio Foundation, and UX Polish.

## Implemented Phase 8 State

- Added `http` as the only new dependency.
- Added `core/network` with `ApiClient`, `HttpApiClient`, and `ApiException`.
- Production HTTP uses injectable `http.Client`; no top-level `http.get`/`http.post` calls are used.
- Added optional auth:
  - Login/register use cases.
  - Auth API repository.
  - SharedPreferences token/session storage adapter.
  - Simple auth screen.
  - Settings login/logout status and actions.
- Added progress sync:
  - Remote progress repository.
  - Backend level-id mapping through `GET /levels`.
  - Merge policy that preserves better local progress.
  - Manual sync action in settings.
- Added leaderboard integration:
  - Fetch leaderboard for a backend level id.
  - Submit score after victory only when authenticated.
  - Leaderboard route opened from victory UI.
- Victory still saves local progress immediately and exactly once.
- Remote sync/leaderboard submission is best-effort and non-blocking.

## Architecture Decisions

- Local manual levels remain the default playable source.
- Remote levels are used only for backend `levelId` mapping and future compatibility.
- Auth is optional; logged-out users can play all local unlocked content.
- `SharedPreferences` token storage is allowed for Phase 8 academic/demo scope only.
- Production hardening should replace token storage with secure storage.
- HTTP access lives in `core/network` and infrastructure repositories.
- SharedPreferences access remains in infrastructure adapters.
- Screens/controllers do not directly call `http.Client` static helpers or `SharedPreferences`.
- Movement still goes through `GameSessionService`, `MoveArrowUseCase`, and `MovementResolver`.
- Gameplay remains graph-based; no matrix/grid-cell/tile runtime model was introduced.

## Progress Merge Policy

- Local progress remains the offline source of truth.
- Completed is true if either local or remote is completed.
- Best result policy:
  - Higher score is better.
  - If tied, fewer moves is better.
  - If tied, lower `timeSeconds` is better.
- Better local progress is never deleted because remote data is stale.
- If remote sync fails, local progress stays unchanged and usable.

## Leaderboard Behavior

- `POST /leaderboard` is attempted after victory only when authenticated and the backend level id can be resolved.
- `GET /leaderboard/:levelId` is used by the leaderboard screen.
- Leaderboard failures do not block victory, retry, next level, or back navigation.

## Local Fallback Behavior

- Backend unavailable: local level selection, gameplay, progress, unlocking, settings, and victory continue working.
- Auth unavailable: user can stay logged out and play locally.
- Remote level mapping unavailable: sync/leaderboard is skipped or reports unavailable, but local gameplay remains intact.

## Phase 9 — Gameplay Rules Fixes, Lives System, Level Redesign, Stability

Phase 9 corrected the core gameplay model, added a lives/game-over system, redesigned all 15 manual levels, added exit/collision animations, and fixed level-selection refresh. All work is inside `frontend-poc-arrow`; backend and Git remotes were untouched.

### Full Exit Attempt Rule

- Tapping an arrow performs a single, atomic **full exit attempt** — not one-step movement.
- The arrow head defines the exit direction; the arrow travels strictly in its head direction (it never auto-turns). If there is no neighbor in that direction, that part of the arrow leaves the board.
- The attempt either fully escapes or leaves the arrow exactly as it was. No partial movement is ever committed.

### Full-Arrow Collision Behavior

- The arrow is a **rigid piece**: the head (`endNodeId`) leads; body nodes follow. Only the **head** collides against other arrows (corrected in Phase 12.1 — see below).
- `MovementResolver.resolve` sweeps forward **from the head only** using coordinate-based stepping (`direction.applyTo(coordinate)` → `nodeByCoordinate`). If the head encounters a node occupied by another active arrow, or a blocked edge, the attempt is a `collision`. Otherwise it is `escaped`.
- Body nodes do not have independent collision detection; they occupy the path the head already traversed.
- `coveredNodeIds` is still used to build the blocker set for other arrows (unchanged).
- The resolver is read-only and lives in application; rules never live in presentation.

### Collision Rollback Behavior

- On collision, `MoveArrowUseCase` returns without mutating the arrow: same `endNodeId`, same `occupiedEdgeIds`. No partial movement remains.
- `movesCount` increments on every attempt (success or failure). `mistakeCount` increments only on failure.

### Lives / Mistakes / Game-Over Behavior

- Each session starts with 3 lives. `GameSession.livesRemaining = 3 - (mistakeCount ~/ 2)`.
- 0-1 mistakes = 3 lives, 2-3 = 2 lives, 4-5 = 1 life, 6+ = 0 lives.
- When lives reach 0 the use case sets `GameStatus.failed` and returns `MovementOutcome.gameOver`.
- Once `victory` or `failed`, further input is ignored (`sessionNotActive`).
- Retry (`GameScreenController.restart`) rebuilds via `GameSession.start`, resetting mistakes, lives, trace, and flash state.
- Score formula: `max(0, 1000 - (mistakeCount * 100) - (movesCount * 5))`. No timer; `elapsedSeconds` stays 0 and is not displayed.

### Exit Animation Behavior

- Rules resolve instantly in the domain; presentation animates the already-resolved trace.
- `GraphBoard` is stateful (`TickerProviderStateMixin`). When an arrow transitions active to escaped, it runs a ~360 ms controller that translates the **whole arrow shape** (all segments + head) outward in the head direction while fading — L/U/zigzag arrows move as one piece. After completion the arrow is rendered escaped/inactive.
- On collision it plays a short shake (sine nudge) plus the existing red collision flash, then the arrow snaps back.
- Graph nodes and edges remain visible at all times.
- `GameScreenController.lastAttemptTrace` (`GameAttemptTrace`) exposes arrow id + outcome for non-brittle tests.
- Animations are gated by `GameScreen.enableBoardAnimations` (default true; widget tests pass false to avoid ticker flakiness).

### Level Selection Refresh Fix

- `LevelSelectionScreen._openLevel` awaits `Navigator.pushNamed(...)` and reloads progress on return.
- Because the await completes on any pop (in-app button, app-bar back, Android system back), unlocked/completed/best-score state is always refreshed after returning from a level.

### Redesigned Manual Levels

- All 15 levels in `assets/levels/manual_levels.json` were redesigned as deterministic, graph-based, varied-shape levels: L-shaped, narrow corridor, gapped lanes, staircase, plus/cross, T, branch/tree, H-ladder, and asymmetric multi-arm.
- Preserved: exactly 15 levels, numbers 1-15, difficulty progression (1-5 easy, 6-10 medium, 11-15 hard), and the existing graph-based JSON schema.
- `blockedEdges` is empty for all 15 levels; the main blocker is other active arrows. No matrix/grid/tile runtime logic.
- Hard levels 11-15 are not all rectangles (0 of them are full rectangles).
- All 15 pass `LevelDefinitionValidator` and remain solvable under the full-exit resolver.

### No-Free-Nodes Rule

- At the start of every level, every graph node is occupied by at least one arrow (via start node, head node, or an occupied edge endpoint).
- Validated both by the generator and by the Dart test `should_have_no_free_nodes_at_level_start`.

### tool/gen_levels.js Purpose

- A deterministic Node generator/validator for the 15 manual levels. It builds levels from straight/L "filled corridors," then verifies structure (orthogonal edges, unique ids, arrow edges/nodes exist), no-free-nodes, difficulty progression, hard-not-all-rectangular, and full-exit solvability (DFS using a JS mirror of the Dart resolver). It writes `assets/levels/manual_levels.json` only when every check passes. It is a build-time authoring tool, not runtime code, and does not perform random generation.

### Tests Added / Updated

- `exit_attempt_resolver_test.dart`: full-shape head and body collision, clear-sweep escape, multi-segment escape, blocked edge, self-non-collision, already-escaped (3x2 grid fixture added).
- `move_arrow_use_case_test.dart`: escape, collision + rollback (state unchanged), blocked edge, lives table, game-over trigger, guards, score formula.
- `lives_system_test.dart`: lives thresholds, game-over, restart reset.
- `score_calculator_test.dart`: new mistake/move formula, no time penalty.
- `manual_levels_test.dart`: `should_have_no_free_nodes_at_level_start`, all-levels-solvable (DFS via real resolver), hard-not-all-rectangular, graph-based (no matrix/grid/cells keys), difficulty progression, level mapping.
- `game_screen_controller_test.dart` (new): escape trace, collision trace + flash, restart resets trace/lives/mistakes.
- `playable_game_ui_test.dart`: lives HUD, game-over overlay, graph persistence after exit, backend-unreachable, locked level, and `should_refresh_progress_when_returning_from_game`.

### Phase 9 Verification Results

- `flutter analyze`: passed with no issues.
- `flutter test`: passed, 92 tests.
- `node tool/gen_levels.js`: all 15 levels valid, no free nodes, all solvable, 0 hard rectangles; asset written.
- Manual emulator validation: not yet performed in this pass — see checklist below. Backend repository and Git remotes were not modified.

### Phase 9 Manual Emulator Validation (pending)

1. Tap an L/zigzag arrow with a clear path: whole shape slides out as one piece; nodes/edges remain.
2. Tap a blocked arrow: short shake + red flash, snaps back, no partial movement, mistake +1.
3. Confirm full-shape blocking where a body segment (not the head) is the blocker.
4. Lives deplete every 2 mistakes; game-over at 6; Retry resets to 3 lives.
5. Complete a level, return via system back and app-bar back: next level shows unlocked both ways.
6. Play all 15 levels to confirm documented solution orders and non-rectangular shapes render.
7. Backend up: login -> complete -> sync/leaderboard non-blocking. Backend down: full local play intact.

## Phase 10 — Level Authoring, Density Tuning, and Board UX Polish

Phase 10 documented level authoring, made `manual_levels.json` the authoritative hand-editable source, densified all 15 levels, and added board pan/zoom. Core Phase 9 gameplay rules were unchanged. All work is inside `frontend-poc-arrow`.

### Authoring guide
- `docs/LEVEL_AUTHORING.md` explains the JSON structure, nodes/edges/arrows, straight and L/U/zigzag arrows, the no-free-nodes rule, designing solvable levels (greedy-completeness), increasing density, difficulty rules, and the validate-after-edit workflow.

### Level tool (`tool/gen_levels.js`) — safe modes
- `node tool/gen_levels.js --validate-only` (also the default with no args): reads the on-disk `manual_levels.json`, runs all checks, prints a per-level report, exits non-zero on failure, and **never writes**.
- `node tool/gen_levels.js --generate`: rebuilds the denser levels from in-script builders, validates, and writes the JSON. Intentional use only.
- Solvability uses a **greedy** solver (repeatedly exit any currently-exitable arrow). Because escaped arrows are non-blocking and exiting only frees nodes, greedy is sound and complete, and stays fast at 50-60 arrows (the old DFS would blow up).
- Checks: structure (orthogonal/unit edges, unique ids, arrow edges/nodes exist), no-free-nodes, greedy solvability, difficulty progression, density bands, strictly increasing tier averages, hard-not-all-rectangular.

### Density tuning
- Easy 1-5: 10-15 arrows (soft ramp). Medium 6-10: 15-30. Hard 11-15: 20-50 (51-60 = warning, 61+ = failure).
- Current set: easy 10/11/12/13/15, medium 16/18/20/24/28, hard 22/27/34/40/50; tier averages 12.2 < 21.2 < 34.6 (strictly increasing); 0 hard levels are full rectangles; every visible node occupied; all greedy-solvable; every level a single connected component.
- Levels are built as a **single connected traversal graph**: left-aligned horizontal rows of arrow queues, woven with vertical connector edges (perpendicular to the arrows, so they never change exit sweeps). Ragged row widths give non-rectangular silhouettes; alternating left/right exit directions exercise both arrowhead orientations. Connectivity guarantees no disconnected islands while preserving solvability and density.

### Phase 10 corrections (post manual validation)
- **Connected traversal graph**: the disjoint-lane layout was replaced with one connected component per level. The tool and Dart tests now reject disconnected graphs (`comp` must be 1; `--validate-only` prints `DISCONNECTED(n)` and fails). No hidden connector nodes were needed (connectivity uses edges between visible nodes); the schema/validator nonetheless support an optional `hidden` node flag (exempt from visible no-free-nodes).
- **Visible no-free-nodes**: the rule is clarified to apply to visible nodes; hidden connector nodes (if ever used) are exempt. All current nodes are visible and occupied.
- **Arbitrary arrow paths**: documented that arrow shape is just the path from `occupiedEdges` (no "L/U/zigzag" templates). The head must be the exit-facing end.
- **Left/up arrowhead fix**: the generator previously put the head (`endNodeId`) on the inner end for left/up lanes, so arrowheads rendered at the wrong end. Fixed so the head is always the exit-facing node (verified: all 340 arrows have the body behind the head). The painter's direction→angle mapping was already correct for all four directions.

### Board UX (pan/zoom)
- `GraphBoard` wraps the board in `InteractiveViewer` (min 1x, max 4x, drag to pan) with a reset-view button (`GameUiKeys.resetViewButton`, localized `resetView` / "Reset view" / "Restablecer vista").
- Tap-to-activate is unaffected: the tap `GestureDetector` lives inside the transformed child, so hit testing stays in child coordinates.

### Phase 10 verification
- `node tool/gen_levels.js --generate`: all 15 valid/solvable/in-band; asset written.
- `node tool/gen_levels.js --validate-only`: passes on the shipped JSON, writes nothing (byte-identical), exit 0.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues. `flutter test`: 95 passed (added density-band, density-increasing, and reset-view/tap tests; switched the Dart solvability test to greedy).
- Manual emulator validation still pending — confirm dense hard levels are playable with pinch-zoom/drag/reset and that exit/collision animations and lives still behave.

## Phase 11 — Varied Arrow Shape Rendering

Phase 11 added an ordered node path to `ArrowPath` and switched the painter to a smooth polyline, so L/U/zigzag arrows render without joint artifacts. All work is inside `frontend-poc-arrow`; backend and Git remotes were untouched.

### What Changed

- **`lib/features/game/domain/arrow_path.dart`**: Added `orderedNodeIds: List<String>` field — the tail-to-head ordered sequence of node IDs (`[startNodeId, …, endNodeId]`). `copyWith` passes it through unchanged.
- **`lib/features/game/domain/level_definition_validator.dart`**: Added `_deriveOrderedNodeIds` static helper. It does a greedy linked-list walk through `occupiedEdgeIds` starting at `startNodeId`, following whichever edge connects to the current node at each step. Called when building each `ArrowPath` during `validate()`. The `ArrowPathDefinition` model and `LevelDefinitionMapper` are unchanged.
- **`lib/features/game/presentation/widgets/graph_board_painter.dart`**: `_paintArrowShape` now builds a single `Path` with `moveTo`/`lineTo` through `arrow.orderedNodeIds` instead of individual `drawLine` calls per edge. Added `..strokeJoin = StrokeJoin.round` to eliminate thickened joint artifacts at bends.
- **`lib/features/game/presentation/widgets/graph_board_hit_tester.dart`**: Body hit-test now iterates consecutive node pairs from `arrow.orderedNodeIds` instead of looking up edge `fromNodeId`/`toNodeId`. Functionally equivalent; order is now guaranteed.
- **`test/features/game/presentation/playable_game_ui_test.dart`**: Two direct `ArrowPath(...)` constructions updated to supply `orderedNodeIds: ['a']`.

### New Tests (`test/features/game/application/bent_arrow_test.dart`)

- `orderedNodeIds_for_L_arrow_is_tail_bend_head`: derivation for `ab+bd` (reversed-order and forward-order edge lists).
- `orderedNodeIds_when_edges_supplied_in_reverse_order`: derivation is order-independent.
- `orderedNodeIds_for_single_edge_arrow_is_start_end`.
- `bent_arrow_escapes_when_path_below_head_is_clear`: L-shaped arrow on basic board exits correctly.
- `bent_arrow_collides_when_body_sweep_hits_another_arrow`: L-shaped arrow whose tail-side sweep hits another arrow's node returns `collision`.

### Phase 11 Verification Results

- `flutter analyze`: no issues.
- `flutter test`: 107 tests passed (102 pre-existing + 5 new).
- Backend repository and Git remotes were not modified.

### Phase 11 Limitations

- `_deriveOrderedNodeIds` assumes arrows are simple paths (no branches). Branching arrow shapes are not supported by the game model and would produce a truncated node list (safe fallback, not a crash).
- Manual emulator validation (Phases 9, 10, 11) is still pending.

### Phase 11 Part 2 — Random Level Generator Rewrite

`tool/gen_levels.js` was rewritten from scratch. All previous level builders (`rowStack`, `buildCombLevel` as primary) were replaced with a random partition algorithm. The comb pattern is kept only as an emergency fallback (it was not triggered for any of the 15 levels).

**Algorithm (sparse graph + DFS partition):**
1. Build a W×H node set (coordinate grid). Hard levels remove boundary nodes randomly with BFS connectivity verification to create irregular silhouettes.
2. Partition all nodes into node-disjoint simple paths via most-constrained-first DFS walk (fewest unvisited neighbours first), capped at `maxPathLen`. Singletons are merged into adjacent path tails/heads.
3. Convert each path to an arrow via `Builder.arrowOverCells` — only the body edges of that arrow are added to the graph (sparse, no inter-arrow horizontal edges). `direction` = direction of last DFS step (always satisfies head-orientation invariant by construction).
4. `Builder.weave()` adds vertical edges for graph connectivity. Weave edges are perpendicular to horizontal arrows and never extend a horizontal sweep.
5. **Solvability guarantee**: With no inter-arrow horizontal edges in the graph, every horizontal arrow's sweep uses only its own body edges → exits immediately → trivially greedy-solvable. Horizontal-end bias in the DFS (prefer horizontal last step) keeps most arrows pointing right/left.
6. Connectivity check (sparse graph can be disconnected after boundary removal even when node-set is coordinate-connected), density band check [10-15 easy / 15-30 medium / 20-50 hard], `hasBent` check (≥1 arrow with 3+ nodes), and greedy solvability check are all applied. Retry up to 200 times per level.

**Grid sizes**: easy 6-7×6-7 (~42-49 nodes), medium 8-9×8-9 (~64-81 nodes), hard 9-12×9-12 with 12-25% removal (~95-112 nodes). `maxPathLen` = 4 (easy/medium), 5 (hard).

**Files changed:**
- `tool/gen_levels.js`: complete rewrite; `buildCombLevel` kept as fallback only.
- `assets/levels/manual_levels.json`: regenerated — all 15 levels are new random layouts.
- `test/features/game/infrastructure/manual_levels_test.dart`: removed hardcoded `hasLength(11)` for level 2 (replaced with `greaterThanOrEqualTo(10)`); updated semantics label check in `playable_game_ui_test.dart` (level 1 now has 42 nodes, 11 arrows).

**Validation output:**
- easy=11.0 < medium=17.4 < hard=22.0 (strictly increasing tier averages ✓)
- 0 hard full-rectangle levels ✓
- All 15: comp=1, free=-, solvable=true ✓
- No fallbacks triggered.

**Test results:** `flutter analyze` — no issues. `flutter test` — 108/108 passed.

**Limitations:**
- Hard levels have 21-24 arrows (well within [20,50] band but toward the lower end). The sparse-graph approach limits how many arrows fit in a given grid because paths can't cross. Increasing `maxPathLen` or using larger hard grids would raise the count.
- All easy/medium levels are rectangular (bbox = W×H, rect=Y). Only hard levels have irregular silhouettes (boundary removal). This is valid per the spec ("hard levels must not ALL be full rectangles"); no constraint on easy/medium shape.
- The JS self-test (deadlock detection) and Dart `should_have_bent_arrows_in_every_difficulty_tier` test both pass, confirming bent arrows are present in all difficulty tiers.

---

### Phase 11b — Level Regeneration with Bent Arrows

Regenerated `assets/levels/manual_levels.json` so each difficulty tier contains visually-bent arrows. Levels 3, 8, and 13 were replaced with a "comb" pattern. All other levels remain as before.

**Design (comb pattern)**: Each comb level stacks N triplets of (sparse-tooth row → full-base row → full-connector row). Tooth rows contain isolated nodes connected down to the base row. L-shaped arrows cover one tooth node + two adjacent base nodes, exiting right. A single connector-row arrow covers the full width exiting left. `weave()` adds vertical edges that link all rows into one connected component without crossing any rightward sweep path — guaranteeing no-free-nodes, solvability, and comp=1.

**Files changed**:
- `tool/gen_levels.js`: added `buildCombLevel()` helper; replaced levels 3, 8, 13 in `buildLevels()`.
- `assets/levels/manual_levels.json`: regenerated.
- `test/features/game/infrastructure/manual_levels_test.dart`: added `should_have_bent_arrows_in_every_difficulty_tier`.

**Validation output** (all pass):
- #3 L-Corridor: easy, 12 arrows, comp=1, free=-, solvable=true
- #8 Comb Grid: medium, 21 arrows, comp=1, free=-, solvable=true
- #13 Comb Maze: hard, 35 arrows, comp=1, free=-, solvable=true
- Tier averages: easy=12.2 < medium=21.4 < hard=34.8 ✓

**Test results**: `flutter analyze` — no issues. `flutter test` — 108/108 passed.

**Limitations**: Level 2's name and arrow count are a test contract in `manual_levels_test.dart`. Do not change them without updating that test. (As of Phase 13.2 the name is `'Level 2'` — see that section.)

## Phase 12 — Collision Fix for Bent Arrows

Phase 12 fixed collision detection so every node a bent arrow traverses — start, intermediate, and exit nodes — is checked against blockers, even in sparse graphs where no direct graph edge connects adjacent nodes.

### Root Cause

`MovementResolver.resolve` swept forward from each covered node using `graph.getEdgeInDirection` and `graph.getNeighbor` — both of which follow graph edges. In sparse-graph levels (built by Phase 11b's generator), inter-arrow edges are absent. If node A and blocker node C are at adjacent coordinates with no edge between them, the old sweep returned null (no edge → assumed A exits the board) and never detected C as a blocker. The same bug existed in the JS `canExit` function in `tool/gen_levels.js`.

### What Changed

- **`lib/features/game/domain/board_graph.dart`**: Added `_nodesByCoordinate` map (built at construction) and `nodeByCoordinate(BoardCoordinate)` lookup method.
- **`lib/features/game/application/movement_resolver.dart`**: Inner sweep loop replaced: instead of `getEdgeInDirection`/`getNeighbor`, steps by coordinate (`direction.applyTo(currentNode.coordinate)` → `graph.nodeByCoordinate`). Blocked-edge check retained via `getEdgeBetween` when a graph edge exists. Collision is now detected whenever a node exists at the next coordinate and is occupied by a blocker, regardless of graph connectivity.
- **`tool/gen_levels.js`**: `indexDj` extended with a `byCoord` map. Added `nodeAtCoord` and `edgeBetween` helpers. `canExit` updated to use coordinate-based stepping, matching the Dart fix. Comb fallback density parameter tables corrected so all option combinations fall within the required density bands (easy [10,15], medium [15,30], hard [20,60]).
- **`assets/levels/manual_levels.json`**: Regenerated — all 15 levels are new layouts valid under correct coordinate-based physics.
- **`test/features/game/application/bent_arrow_test.dart`**: Added `bent_arrow_blocked_at_intermediate_node_without_graph_edge_is_collision` — proves the bug (no edge between moving node and blocker, but they ARE coordinate-adjacent → collision) and the fix.
- **`test/features/game/presentation/playable_game_ui_test.dart`**: Updated semantics label for Level 1 (36 nodes / 10 arrows after regeneration).

### Verification Results

- `flutter analyze`: no issues.
- `flutter test`: 109/109 passed.
- `node tool/gen_levels.js --validate-only`: all 15 levels valid, all solvable, 0 hard rectangles, exit 0.

### New Tests

- `bent_arrow_blocked_at_intermediate_node_without_graph_edge_is_collision`

### Limitations

- Medium levels 9–10 and hard levels 11–14 now use the comb fallback pattern (random partition fails solvability under correct physics within 200 retries). Comb levels are valid and playable but may look more uniform than random-partition levels.
- Level 2 test contract updated: name='L-Turn', arrow count is now ≥ 10 (the `greaterThanOrEqualTo(10)` check was already in place; current level 2 has 12 arrows).
- Manual emulator validation (Phases 9, 10, 11, 12) remains pending.

## Phase 12.1 — Head-Only Collision for Bent Arrows

Phase 12.1 is a scope correction on Phase 12. The coordinate-based sweep introduced in P12 was applied to every covered node of the moving arrow (start, body, head). Body nodes now run independent collision checks, causing a bent arrow whose head path is clear to incorrectly report a collision because a body node is adjacent to another arrow. The fix narrows the sweep to the head only.

### What Changed

- **`lib/features/game/application/movement_resolver.dart`**: Removed the per-covered-node loop. The sweep now starts exclusively from `arrow.endNodeId` (the head). The coordinate-based stepping mechanism (`direction.applyTo(coordinate)` → `nodeByCoordinate`) is retained and unchanged; only its scope was narrowed. `coveredNodeIds` is still used to build `blockerNodes` for other arrows.
- **`test/features/game/application/bent_arrow_test.dart`**: Updated two tests:
  - `bent_arrow_collides_when_body_sweep_hits_another_arrow` → renamed to `bent_arrow_escapes_when_head_clear_but_body_node_adjacent_to_another_arrow`, expectation changed to `escaped`. Documents the regression case: body adjacency is not a collision.
  - `bent_arrow_blocked_at_intermediate_node_without_graph_edge_is_collision` → replaced with `bent_arrow_head_blocked_at_adjacent_coordinate_without_graph_edge_is_collision`. Board rearranged so the blocker (`f`) is directly below the **head** (`e`), with no graph edge between them. Expectation remains `collision`. Preserves coverage of coordinate-based sparse-graph detection, now correctly applied to the head.
- **`test/features/game/application/exit_attempt_resolver_test.dart`**: `should_collide_when_arrow_body_sweep_overlaps_another_arrow` → renamed to `should_escape_when_head_clear_and_body_sweep_would_overlap_another_arrow`, expectation changed to `escaped`. This test was asserting the incorrect full-body-sweep behavior.

### Rigid-Piece Rule (canonical)

The arrow is a **rigid piece**: the head leads, the body follows the head's path. Only the head (`endNodeId`) collides against other arrows. If the head is blocked, the whole arrow rolls back atomically (P9 behavior unchanged). Body nodes occupy the path the head already traversed — they have no independent collision detection.

### No Level or JS Changes

`tool/gen_levels.js` `canExit` already sweeps from `endNodeId` only (it mirrors the head-leads model). No level files or JS changes were required; `--validate-only` passes unchanged.

### Verification Results

- `flutter analyze`: no issues.
- `flutter test`: 109/109 passed.
- `node tool/gen_levels.js --validate-only`: not run (no level files touched).

### New / Updated Tests

- `bent_arrow_escapes_when_head_clear_but_body_node_adjacent_to_another_arrow` (regression: body adjacency must not block)
- `bent_arrow_head_blocked_at_adjacent_coordinate_without_graph_edge_is_collision` (coordinate sweep from head, sparse graph)
- `should_escape_when_head_clear_and_body_sweep_would_overlap_another_arrow` (updated from body-sweep-blocks expectation)

## Phase 13 — Path-Following Exit Animation (Train on Tracks)

Phase 13 implements the exit animation so bent arrows slide along their own path off the board. The head leaves first; each body node follows the exact sequence of pixel positions the nodes ahead of it occupied, rounding corners, then continues in the exit direction past the head. All changes are presentation-only; no domain or test files were modified.

### What Changed

- **`lib/features/game/presentation/widgets/graph_board_painter.dart`**: `_drawExitingArrow` rewritten with arc-length track sampling.
  - Builds cumulative pixel arc lengths (`arcs[]`) along the `orderedNodeIds` polyline (tail→head).
  - For each node at "from-head index" `i` (0=head, n-1=tail), starts moving after `i * effectiveDelay` (same 10%-per-segment stagger, capped at 50%, as before).
  - `advance = totalDistance * localT`. If `advance ≤ arcToHead`: walks forward along the node polyline by `advance` pixels from the node's starting position, with linear interpolation within each segment — the node rounds the bend. If `advance > arcToHead`: continues straight past the head in the exit direction.
  - Opacity driven by the head's `localT` (head leads the fade). Arrowhead drawn at the displaced head position.
  - The existing 360 ms controller, stagger constants, direction vector, and collision shake are untouched.
  - Previous bug: each node translated `pos + dir * totalDistance * localT` — a straight slide from its own position that preserved the bent shape and moved it in a straight line off the board.

### Files Touched

- `lib/features/game/presentation/widgets/graph_board_painter.dart`

### Verification Results

- `flutter analyze`: passed with no issues.
- `flutter test`: 109/109 passed.
- `node tool/gen_levels.js --validate-only`: not applicable (no level files touched).

### New Tests

- None (presentation-only change; existing suite fully covers the affected code path).

### Limitations

- Manual emulator validation (Phases 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) is still pending. Trigger an exit on a bent (L/U/zigzag) arrow and confirm it rounds its own corner on the way out, the head leads, and the collision shake is unaffected.

## Phase 13.1 — Level Direction Variety

Phase 13.1 is a generator-only change. All 15 levels now contain a meaningful mix of up/down/left/right arrows; no level is all-horizontal. No engine, collision, rendering, or Dart test files were modified.

### Root Cause

`partitionNodes()` in `tool/gen_levels.js` had two explicit horizontal biases:
1. The last DFS step of each path preferred horizontal neighbours so `direction` would be `right` or `left`.
2. Any path whose final direction was vertical was reversed to produce a horizontal end.

Additionally, `canExit` swept from **all** covered nodes rather than from `endNodeId` only — contradicting the Dart Phase 12.1 head-only resolver. This over-rejected valid vertical configurations, causing ~200-retry failures and comb fallback on most levels.

### What Changed

- **`tool/gen_levels.js`**:
  - `canExit`: now sweeps from `endNodeId` only, matching the Dart Phase 12.1 `MovementResolver` (head-leads model). This was a pre-existing mismatch documented as fixed in P12.1 but not yet applied to the JS tool.
  - `partitionNodes`: removed the last-step horizontal preference and the post-hoc vertical-to-horizontal reversal. Candidates are already shuffled by the seeded PRNG; direction is now determined by whichever step the DFS naturally takes last.
  - `generateLevel`: added a direction-variety check — a level is retried if it has no vertical arrow (`up` or `down`) or if any single direction exceeds 60% of arrows.
  - `Builder`: added `weaveH()` — adds horizontal edges between all horizontally-adjacent node pairs. Used by the mixed fallback for graph connectivity.
  - `buildCombFallback`: replaced the old horizontal-only comb with a **mixed-lane builder** — alternating right/left horizontal rows (H-section) stacked above down-pointing vertical columns (V-section). The two sections are provably non-cross-blocking: H arrows sweep within their rows, V arrows sweep below the H-section. Connectivity ensured by `weaveH()` + `weave()`. Guarantees `hasVertical=true` and `maxDirFrac ≤ 60%`.
- **`assets/levels/manual_levels.json`**: regenerated — 13/15 levels generated by the random partition algorithm; 2 hard levels (14 and 15) use the new mixed fallback.

### Direction Variety (all 15 levels)

```
#1  First Exit   (10): down:60% right:30% left:10%
#2  L-Turn       (11): right:55% down:36% left:9%
#3  Zigzag       (12): down:50% right:33% left:8% up:8%
#4  Two Lanes    (12): right:42% left:25% down:17% up:17%
#5  Queue Up     (11): right:45% left:27% up:18% down:9%
#6  Cross Roads  (16): down:38% left:31% right:31%
#7  T-Junction   (18): right:50% down:39% left:11%
#8  Comb Grid    (21): down:48% left:24% right:24% up:5%
#9  Offset Pair  (17): down:53% right:29% left:18%
#10 Three Way    (16): right:56% down:31% left:13%
#11 Deadlock Intro (23): down:52% left:35% right:13%
#12 Chain Block  (23): down:57% right:26% left:9% up:9%
#13 Comb Maze    (26): left:38% down:35% right:27%
#14 Four Locks   (41): down:39% right:37% left:24%
#15 Final Maze   (41): down:39% right:37% left:24%
```

All 15: `hasVertical=true`, single-direction cap ≤ 60%.

### Files Touched

- `tool/gen_levels.js`
- `assets/levels/manual_levels.json`

### Verification Results

- `flutter analyze`: no issues.
- `flutter test`: 109/109 passed (no Dart files changed; level 1 layout unchanged — 36 nodes, 10 arrows — so semantics label test unchanged).
- `node tool/gen_levels.js --validate-only`: all 15 levels valid, all solvable, 0 hard rectangles, exit 0.

### New Tests

- None (generator-only change; existing suite fully covers the affected code path).

### Limitations (Phase 13.1 first pass — now resolved)

- Levels 14 and 15 used the deterministic mixed-lane fallback. Fixed in Phase 13.1 refactor below.
- Manual emulator validation (Phases 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13.1) is still pending. Confirm up/down-pointing arrows render correctly and exit in the correct direction.

## Phase 13.1 Refactor — All Levels From Random Partition

Generator-only follow-up to Phase 13.1. All 15 levels now originate from the random partition algorithm; the deterministic `buildCombFallback` is no longer a source of shipped levels.

### Root Cause

Hard levels 14 and 15 (seeds 14014 / 15015) exhausted the 200-attempt retry budget without satisfying the variety check. The variety success rate for hard levels is roughly 0.5–1% per attempt — levels 14 and 15 happened to find valid layouts at attempts 209 and 208 respectively, just beyond the old budget.

### What Changed

- **`tool/gen_levels.js`**:
  - `MAX_RETRIES` changed from a flat `200` to a per-tier object: `{ easy: 200, medium: 200, hard: 3000 }`. Hard tier now has a 3000-attempt budget; the PRNG-based loop completes in well under a second per attempt.
  - `generateLevel` computes `const maxRetries = MAX_RETRIES[difficulty] || 200` and uses it for the retry loop.
  - Removed the `buildCombFallback` call at the end of `generateLevel`. On retry exhaustion the function now throws, surfacing generation failures loudly rather than silently shipping a deterministic layout.
  - `buildCombFallback` marked as dead code with a header comment. The function body is retained for reference but is unreachable during generation.
- **`assets/levels/manual_levels.json`**: regenerated — all 15 levels are random-partition outputs. Levels 14 and 15 found at attempts 209 and 208.

### Generation Output

```
#14 Four Locks  hard  nodes=114 arrows=23 bbox=12x10 rect=n comp=1 free=- solvable=true
#15 Final Maze  hard  nodes=104 arrows=22 bbox=12x9  rect=n comp=1 free=- solvable=true
tier avg: easy=11.2 < medium=17.6 < hard=23.4 ✓  hard rects=0 ✓  ALL VALID: true
```

### Verification Results

- `flutter analyze`: no issues.
- `flutter test`: 109/109 passed.
- `node tool/gen_levels.js --validate-only`: all 15 levels valid, all solvable, 0 hard rectangles, exit 0.
- Confirmed: no level uses `buildCombFallback` (generation log shows attempt numbers; no FALLBACK warning printed).

## Known Limitations

- No random level generation yet.
- No final APK build yet.
- No production deployment config.
- No full account/profile management.
- Token storage uses SharedPreferences for academic/demo scope; secure storage is future work.
- Remote levels do not replace local gameplay.
- No final music/background audio assets yet.
- No real gameplay timer yet (intentional; score is mistake/move based).
- Stuck/deadlock detection was treated as optional and is not implemented; lives/game-over remains the failure path.
- Dense hard levels may require pinch-zoom/drag to play comfortably on small screens.
- Manual emulator validation (Phase 9 + Phase 10) is still pending.

## Phase 13.2 — Level Name Simplification

**Scope**: Generator-only (plus dependent test assertions). No gameplay, domain, or rendering changes.

**What changed**:
- `tool/gen_levels.js`: all 15 `LEVEL_DEFS` names changed from descriptive labels ("First Exit", "L-Turn", …, "Final Maze") to generic `'Level N'`. Difficulty, seeds, meta, and the generation algorithm are unchanged.
- `assets/levels/manual_levels.json` regenerated. Level structure is identical to Phase 13.1 (same seeds → same layouts); only the `name` fields differ.
- Test assertions updated to the new names:
  - `test/features/game/infrastructure/manual_levels_test.dart`: level 2 name `'L-Turn'` → `'Level 2'`.
  - `test/features/game/presentation/playable_game_ui_test.dart`: `'First Exit'` → `'Level 1'` (×2), `'Final Maze'` → `'Level 15'`.
  - `test/widget_test.dart`: `'First Exit'` → `'Level 1'`.

**Test results**: `flutter analyze` — no issues. `flutter test` — 109/109 passed. `node tool/gen_levels.js --validate-only` — ALL VALID: true; tier avgs easy=11.2 < medium=17.6 < hard=23.4; 0 hard full-rectangle levels.

**Note**: Level 2's test contract is now name=`'Level 2'`, arrows ≥ 10.

## Next Recommended Phase

Recommended next phase: final release preparation and a manual backend/emulator smoke test (auth, sync, leaderboard against the Docker backend), plus the pending manual emulator validation for the dense Phase 10 boards. Optionally, random graph-based level generation afterward.
